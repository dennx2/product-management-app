# product-management-app
In this project, I created a J2EE web application utilizing JavaServer Pages (JSP) and JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) to facilitate product management. The application interacts with a MySQL database to provide a user-friendly interface for adding, deleting, and displaying product records.
